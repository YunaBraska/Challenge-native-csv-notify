**Challenge - native CSV to SMS and Mail (dummy)** 

We would like you to solve the following coding challenge. Please do so while adhering to the **restrictions** given! 
We expect that it takes you a couple of hours to complete the task. Then take at least 30 minutes and write down 
points that you would improve on if given more time. 

**Restrictions**:
- use plain java and do not add any libraries to pom
- add unit tests for your code
- send it to us as a zip file, the file name must contain your name

**Challenge**:
You are given a piece of code that imports a list of users and sends them an email. 
For this challenge do not implement the necessary code to actually send any message, just write messages to the console.

Please extend, refactor and change the code to **improve** it and add the following features:
1. only enabled users receive emails
2. add the capability to send sms messages
3. make sure possible dispatching options are mail|sms|both

**Assume**:
- file may contain 1 million accounts
- not all accounts are valid

**CodingChallenge aka "LetterMan"**:
- I was not sure if you want to call the applications main class with the file parameter so i kept the functionality there
- The repository is removed, as i don"t know the context of it and how much error handling you need
- So with more time i would get more question and over engineer this
- There is so much stuff you could do like error handling, a real strategy pattern and many more cool stuff which is not requested...
- Usually i am not writing comments but this looks like an unfinished beta of an epic :P 
```java
if(this.code.equals(production)) {
    messages.foreach(donate("Yuna Morgenstern", 1.5D", "EUR").andGetMore(this::Drinks)
}
```
